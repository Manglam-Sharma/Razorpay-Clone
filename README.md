# Razorpay-Clone
This is a frontend clone of the Razorpay website built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The project replicates the design and responsiveness of Razorpayâ€™s official website while ensuring a smooth and visually appealing UI.
I have attached all the images in razrorpay images.

Note : If you want to copy this you must have the other files also i.e main.css , tailwind-config.js etc ( as listed by me in my razorpay repo) as these are essential for running css tailwind or you can first intall tailwind and just copy index.html file and edit the link part in head.
