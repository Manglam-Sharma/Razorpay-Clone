# Razorpay-Clone
This is a frontend clone of the Razorpay website built using HTML and Tailwind CSS. The project replicates the design and responsiveness of Razorpayâ€™s official website while ensuring a smooth and visually appealing UI.
I have attached all the images in razrorpay images. 

About Razorpay
Razorpay is a leading payment gateway provider that enables businesses in India to accept, process, and disburse payments online. It offers various payment solutions, including credit/debit card payments, UPI, net banking, and wallets, making online transactions seamless and secure.

Note : If you want to copy this you must have the other files also i.e main.css , tailwind-config.js etc ( as listed by me in my razorpay repo) as these are essential for running css tailwind or you can first intall tailwind and just copy index.html file and edit the link part in head.
